# TypeaheadFiles
Incremental search for files on disk in selected directories


        # get app running as service in windows (and later linux and os/x)
        # make the service "wake up" (do something) from a global command
        # create a simple and lightweight swing(?) app with only one text box for searching (inc. search)
        # open the text field from the global command
        # under the text box, create a list (text area sort of?) that should contain the search results
        # get incremental search working
        # use a db or simply keep updated version in memory?
        # look in configured directories recursively after files
        # add options: file type(s) to search for
        # add options: two columns (dev/stable) or three columns (name/dev bool/stable bool)
